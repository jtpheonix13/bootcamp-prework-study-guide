# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was created as part of my prework assignment to develop a study guide to store my
notes on HTML, CSS, Javascrip, and Git.
As I continue to study on my own in preparation for the course I can use what i've learned to 
update the webpage with new notes for each category.

To use this study guide you can review the notes in each section. To decide what to study first you can open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I on MacOS or Control+Shift+I on Windows. A console panel should open in the browser. There you will see a list of topics I've learned so far along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
